        "This course is a hands-on course in solving computational problems.  In most Chemical Engineering courses the emphasis has been on how to approach problems from first principles, derive, then solve specific equations.  In this class, we return to these problems from the real-life perspective where one has some data and want to make best use of it.  Unlike traditional theory laden courses, this course will offer a less mathematical, yet intuitively appealing explanation and hands-on approach to a variety of computational strategies.  The ideal title of this course, if permissible, would have been \"Chemical Engineering for Hackers\".\n",

Make your first recording attempt no later than the 3rd day after the HW is assigned.  It will be much harder than you think - do not procrastinate.  Your camera angles should provide <u>irrefutable</u> evidence that the work is not merely being copied and read aloud."
